## Description

This freeway dashboard was my homework for the "Macro programming and data analytics" course. The objective of this hoemwork was to think of a freeway scenario that requrires a dashboard to provide insights. The scenario that I came up with was :

On weekends and holidays, the freewyas often face severre traffic congestion. Therefore, the goal is to use data analysis and create a dashboard to transform raw data into meaningful information, allowing users to quickly and instinctly derive any information they wish to know by clicking the interactive componenets.
