# Excel-freeway-dashboard

## Description

This freeway dashboard was my homework for the "Macro programming and data analytics" course. The objective of this hoemwork was to think of a freeway scenario that requrires a dashboard to provide insights. The scenario that I came up with was :

On weekends and holidays, the freewyas often face severre traffic congestion. Therefore, the goal is to use data analysis and create a dashboard to transform raw data into meaningful information, allowing users to quickly and instinctly derive any information they wish to know by clicking the interactive componenets.

## Insights 
From the dashboard, we can see that traffic volume is higher on Sundays than on Saturdays. Regarding the timing, traffic congestion ususally occurs from around 10:00 am to around 7:00 pm. The congestion on the northbound section of Natinoal Freeway 1 from Neihu to Donghu and the southbound section from Zhongli Service Area to Neili is more severe than on the northbound section of National Freeway 3 from Nangang to Xintaiwu Road. 
It is reccomended to implement policies targeting these two sections first, such as adjusting the signal lights at entrance ramps based on traffic flow or encouraging the public to take alternate routes to avoid peak hours through radio or news.
